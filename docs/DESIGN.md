# **dehydrator** Engineering the Autonomous Code Compression Utility: A Professional Framework for Semantic Refactoring

The contemporary software development landscape is increasingly defined by a tension between rapid feature delivery and the escalating cognitive load required to maintain expansive codebases. As projects evolve, the accumulation of technical debt, redundant logic, and non-idiomatic implementation patterns creates a barrier to developer comprehension and velocity. The introduction of agentic artificial intelligence provides a novel mechanism for addressing these challenges through autonomous, context-aware code refactoring. This report delineates the design and implementation of a local command-line interface (CLI) application engineered to explore, optimize, and compress codebases. The objective is to minimize the scope of code requiring human understanding by replacing repeating patterns and verbose structures with high-level abstractions and popular design patterns.

## **The Cognitive Crisis in Modern Software Engineering**

The primary motivation for an autonomous code compression utility lies in the reduction of "contextual debt." Modern developers frequently spend a disproportionate amount of time navigating boilerplate and redundant logic rather than implementing novel features. Research indicates that while 78% of developers believe AI tools improve productivity, the actual completion time for complex tasks can increase by 19% when AI is used without rigorous structural constraints.1 This productivity paradox suggests that code generation alone is insufficient; rather, the focus must shift toward code refinement and the optimization of human readability.  
The philosophy of "Less is More" in software engineering emphasizes that every line of code is a liability. A compressed codebase reduces the surface area for bugs, simplifies the onboarding process for new engineers, and lowers the mental energy required for system-wide reasoning.2 Traditional metrics like cyclomatic complexity often fail to capture the "cognitive friction" felt by developers, necessitating a new approach that evaluates code not just by its execution paths but by its semantic density and adherence to idiomatic patterns.3

## **State of the Art: Comparative Analysis of Agentic Coding Tools**

A comprehensive survey of the current market reveals a maturation of terminal-based AI agents. These tools provide the foundational concepts upon which a specialized code compression utility can be built.

### **Existing CLI Agent Landscapes**

| Tool Name       | Core Architecture                | Primary Strength                         | Model Orchestration                  |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Aider**       | Git-native, Tree-sitter Repo Map | High efficiency, minimal context bloat   | Support for 100+ local/remote models |
| **Claude Code** | Agentic, API-first               | Deep reasoning, complex task planning    | Anthropic Claude Series (Remote)     |
| **Cline CLI**   | MCP-based, Parallel Agency       | Task decomposition, multi-editor support | Flexible (Ollama, OpenRouter, Cloud) |
| **Codex CLI**   | OpenAI-native                    | Lightweight, direct GPT integration      | OpenAI (Remote)                      |
| **Gemini CLI**  | ReAct loop, 1M+ Context          | Large-scale project analysis             | Google Gemini (Remote)               |
| **RIdiom**      | AST-based Pattern Matching       | Language-specific idiomatic refactoring  | Hybrid (Rule-based \+ LLM)           |

Source: 1  
The analysis of these tools identifies several architectural patterns suitable for a compression utility. Aider’s use of a repository map—a concise overview of classes, functions, and signatures—is essential for providing context without exceeding LLM token limits.8 Claude Code demonstrates the efficacy of "autonomous multi-step workflows," where the agent can plan, execute, and verify changes across multiple files without constant human intervention.7 Cline’s integration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) suggests a standardized way to allow local agents to interact with the filesystem, shell, and external reasoning servers.10

### **Distinctions in Agentic Philosophy**

There is a fundamental difference between "Suggestion" agents (integrated into IDE sidebars) and "Delegation" agents (CLI-based). CLI agents, such as the one proposed in this framework, are designed for autonomous, multi-file operations. Terminal interfaces naturally support "progressive disclosure," where the agent only loads the context necessary for a specific task, reducing hallucinations and grounding the model in the reality of the filesystem.12 This "filesystem as the only state" approach ensures that changes are deterministic and verifiable through standard terminal tools.12

## **Project Idea: The Semantic Compression Engine**

The proposed application is defined as a "Semantic Compression Engine." Unlike general-purpose coding assistants, its primary directive is the systematic reduction of codebase volume and complexity while maintaining 100% functional parity.

### **Core Principles and Philosophies**

The engine operates on four foundational principles:

1. **Semantic Parity:** No refactoring action is taken unless the external behavior of the system remains identical. This is verified through automated testing and AST-based equivalence checking.14
2. **Contextual Density:** The goal is to maximize the information-per-line ratio. Verbose logic is collapsed into higher-level abstractions or standard library features.2
3. **Idiomatic Alignment:** The engine prioritizes "popular and known patterns" over custom abstractions. If code uses an uncommon or idiosyncratic approach to a common problem, it is refactored toward standard design patterns such as Factory, Strategy, or Observer.18
4. **Local-First Autonomy:** To preserve project security and accommodate developer preferences, the tool prioritizes local execution and model interaction, while allowing remote escalation for complex reasoning tasks.20

### **Required Features and Capabilities**

The feature set is designed to support the complete lifecycle of a refactoring session:

- **Deep Repository Mapping:** The system must scan the project to build a graph of dependencies and symbol definitions using Tree-sitter.8
- **Deduplication Detection:** Identification of repeating logic patterns across disparate files using vector embeddings and semantic search.23
- **Idiom Investigation:** Automated analysis of "uncommon" code sections to determine if they can be mapped to idiomatic language constructs (e.g., Pythonic comprehensions or Java streams).19
- **Design Pattern Injection:** Capability to suggest and implement standard design patterns to simplify complex control flows.18
- **In-Place Editing with Rollback:** Modification of files directly on disk, integrated with Git to allow immediate revert and change attribution.26
- **Reporting and Metrics:** A comprehensive output describing the "Cognitive Surface Area" reduction, LOC changes, and complexity improvements.28

## **Technical Requirements and Architecture**

Building a tool capable of autonomous refactoring requires a robust multi-layered architecture that combines static code analysis with dynamic LLM-driven reasoning.

### **Data Collection and Code Analysis Layer**

The application utilizes **Tree-sitter** for universal language parsing. Tree-sitter builds a concrete syntax tree (CST) and efficiently updates it as the file is edited.30 This allows the CLI to identify specific code structures—such as for loops, class definitions, or if-else blocks—without the brittleness of regular expressions.8

| Component            | Technology                     | Role in Architecture                                |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parser**           | Tree-sitter                    | AST/CST construction and symbol extraction          |
| **Context Resolver** | Language Server Protocol (LSP) | Cross-file symbol resolution and type checking      |
| **Knowledge Base**   | pgvector / ChromaDB            | Storing code embeddings for deduplication detection |
| **Agent Framework**  | Pydantic-AI / LangGraph        | State management and multi-agent orchestration      |
| **Model Router**     | LiteLLM                        | Unified interface for local and remote models       |

Source: 13  
The integration of the **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** is critical. While LLMs excel at pattern recognition, they do not inherently perform symbol resolution.33 The LSP provides the necessary type information and reference tracking to ensure that a refactoring in one module does not break consumers in another.32

### **The Intelligence and Reasoning Layer**

To handle the "local vs. remote" requirement, the system employs **LiteLLM** for model routing.21 This allows the user to configure a config.yaml that defines different tiers of models based on the task's complexity.21

| Tier                | Task Type                                  | Example Local Model   | Example Remote Model             |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1 (Light)**  | Docstrings, variable renaming              | Llama 3.2:3b (Ollama) | GPT-5-mini                       |
| **Tier 2 (Medium)** | Single-file refactoring, deduplication     | Phi-4 / Qwen 2.5:32b  | Claude 4.6 Opus / GLM 5          |
| **Tier 3 (Heavy)**  | Architectural migration, pattern injection | DeepSeek-V3           | Claude 4.6 Sonnet / GPT-5.3xhigh |

Source: 21  
The intelligence layer uses a "Deep Agent" architecture, where an **Orchestrator** delegates specific sub-tasks to specialized agents.37 The **Explorer** agent investigates the codebase structure; the **Pattern Matcher** agent identifies refactoring opportunities; the **Coder** agent generates the changes; and the **Validator** agent ensures the code compiles and passes tests.37

### **Safety and Git Integration Protocols**

In-place code editing requires stringent safety protocols to prevent data loss or the introduction of bugs.

1. **Git Checkpoints:** The tool must verify a "clean" git state before starting. It should warn user to create a temporary branch or commit before making changes, user has a right to ignore.26
2. **Linting and Testing:** After every refactor, the tool invokes the project's linter and test runner (e.g., pytest, npm test).13 If tests fail, the tool enters a self-correction loop or reverts the change.32
3. **Human-in-the-Loop:** While the tool operates in the terminal, it should follow a "Plan and Act" workflow. The user is presented with a diff and an explanation of the "why" before the changes are committed to disk. But if pre-approval flag is set to be true, we skip approval and move to execute phase right after the planning and keep the plan for final report.10

## **Strategies for Code Compression and Optimization**

The application focuses on specific refactoring vectors designed to "compress" the codebase.

### **Deduplication and DRY Enforcement**

The system identifies "Repeating Patterns" that deviate from the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This is achieved through semantic similarity analysis. Code snippets are transformed into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) and compared; clusters of similar vectors indicate potential duplication even if variable names differ.23

| Refactoring Pattern   | Context for Application                      | Complexity Impact                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Extract Method**    | Multiple identical logic blocks found        | Reduces duplication, increases modularity      |
| **Generalize Class**  | Similar classes with minor variations        | Uses inheritance or composition to reduce LOC  |
| **Utility Migration** | Common helper logic found across the project | Centralizes logic into a shared utility module |

### **Idiomatization: Transforming Uncommon Code**

The "Uncommon Code" investigation focuses on aligning implementation with modern, idiomatic standards. For instance, in Python, a multi-line for loop that filters and transforms a list can be compressed into a single-line list comprehension.19 Research shows that while idiomatic code is more concise, it can sometimes be "harder to read" for beginners; however, for professional development, it reduces the volume of code that must be maintained.41  
Research into "Pythonic Idioms" has defined specific syntactic patterns for detection using AST traversal:

- **List/Set/Dict Comprehensions:** Replacing procedural object initialization.19
- **Chain Comparison:** Simplifying multiple inequality checks.19
- **Context Managers (with):** Ensuring safe resource handling without explicit try-finally blocks.19
- **F-strings:** Replacing verbose string concatenation.25

### **Design Pattern Injection**

When the system encounters complex, nested conditional logic or sprawling "God objects," it investigates refactoring toward standard design patterns. This simplifies the architectural scope.18

- **Factory Pattern:** Replaces complex conditional object instantiation with a centralized creation logic.18
- **Strategy Pattern:** Encapsulates algorithms into separate classes, allowing the main logic to remain clean and focused.18
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Breaking down large functions that have "grown too large" into atomic units with clearly defined roles.18

## **Measuring Code Health: The LM-CC Framework**

Traditional metrics like Lines of Code (LOC) or Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) provide only a partial picture of maintainability. The application integrates the **LM-CC (LLM-perceived Code Complexity)** metric, which measures the "difficulty" an LLM has in processing and reasoning about a snippet of code.4  
LM-CC acknowledges that LLM predictive entropy—the uncertainty of the model—accumulates with hierarchical depth and branching.5 By optimizing for low LM-CC, the application ensures the code is not just shorter, but structured in a way that is semantically clear to both AI agents and human developers.4

| Metric Type               | Calculation Basis                           | Developer Experience Impact                  |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | Number of independent execution paths       | High scores correlate with high defect rates |
| **Halstead Difficulty**   | Distribution of operators and operands      | Predicts time and effort for comprehension   |
| **Maintainability Index** | Composite of LOC, CC, and Volume            | Overall health score (0-100)                 |
| **Cognitive Complexity**  | Penalizes nested structures and indirection | Approximates human mental effort             |

## **Project Implementation Roadmap**

The development of the Compression CLI is organized into five distinct phases, moving from passive observation to active, autonomous refactoring.

### **Phase 1: Contextual Foundation and Mapping**

The objective is to establish a deep understanding of the repository structure.

1. **Initialize Parser:** Integrate Tree-sitter for multi-language support and implement the repository mapping logic.8
2. **LSP Integration:** Establish a communication bridge with local Language Servers to enable cross-file symbol resolution.32
3. **Git Awareness:** Implement the Git-native workflow, ensuring every change is a traceable commit with a descriptive message.26

### **Phase 2: Pattern Discovery and Analysis**

The system begins to identify areas for optimization without modifying code.

1. **Metrics Suite:** Implement Cyclomatic and Cognitive complexity calculators to flag "hotspots".24
2. **Semantic Clustering:** Generate vector embeddings for every function and class; use k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to find functional duplicates.23
3. **Investigation Engine:** Prompt the LLM to identify "uncommon" patterns and explain why they are suboptimal compared to standard design patterns.18

### **Phase 3: Model Orchestration and Routing**

Enabling the "local vs. remote" flexibility.

1. **LiteLLM Integration:** Create the configuration layer for switching between local (Ollama) and remote (Anthropic/OpenAI/Z.ai) providers.21
2. **Reasoning Pipeline:** Implement the "Plan and Act" agentic loop. The agent must first produce a markdown-based refactoring plan before executing edits.10
3. **Context Packaging:** Develop the "context packing" utility to feed only relevant code snippets and dependency maps to the LLM.43

### **Phase 4: Autonomous Refactoring and Validation**

The "In-Place" editing capability.

1. **Edit Block Execution:** Implement surgical file editing logic that applies only necessary changes rather than rewriting entire files.12
2. **Safety Mirror:** Automate the "Edit \-\> Lint \-\> Test \-\> Commit/Revert" loop.26
3. **Deduplication Handler:** Automate the extraction of repeated logic into shared modules, updating all call sites project-wide.24

### **Phase 5: Reporting and Advanced Intelligence**

Refining the output and adding long-term memory.

1. **The Report Flag:** Implement the \--report functionality to generate a detailed summary of LOC reduction, complexity improvement, and applied design patterns.29
2. **Persistent Memory:** Integrate a local database to store "project-specific idioms" so the agent learns the developer's style over time.37
3. **Autonomous Design Review:** A mode where the agent scans pull requests and suggests compression opportunities before merge.40

## **User Flow and Interaction Design**

The application follows a deterministic terminal-based workflow to ensure developer control and predictability.

### **User-Flow Narrative and Logical Diagrams**

The interaction is modeled as a "Desktop Commander" pattern, where the user delegates a task and the agent executes it in the project folder.12  
**The Standard Interaction Flow:**

1. **Environment Navigation:** The user enters the project directory and executes the tool.
   - _Input:_ cd /my-project && compress-cli
2. **Discovery Loop:** The tool performs an initial scan (10-60 seconds) and reports "hotspots" of redundancy or complexity.
   - _Output:_ "Found 4 duplicate modules and 12 functions exceeding complexity threshold 10."
3. **Interactive Refactoring:** The user initiates a specific refactor or asks for a general project-wide compression.
   - _Input:_ compress-cli \--deduplicate or compress-cli \--pattern strategy \--target /services
4. **Planning Phase:** The app displays a planned diff and asks for approval.
   - _System Action:_ "I will extract the validation logic from auth.js and api.js into a new utils/validator.js. Do you approve?"
5. **In-Place Execution:** Upon approval, the tool edits the files, runs the test suite, and commits the changes to Git.
   - _System Action:_ git commit \-m "refactor: deduplicate validation logic".27
6. **Final Reporting:** If the user requested a report, a comprehensive file is generated.
   - _Input:_ compress-cli \--report

### **Logical User-Flow Diagram**

| Step           | User Action          | System Process                            | Outcome                   |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |

| **2\. Scan**   | Request analysis     | Vector Embedding \+ Complexity Check      | Hotspots Identified       |
| **3\. Plan**   | Choose refactor task | LLM reasoning over AST \+ Pattern library | Markdown Refactor Plan    |
| **4\. Review** | Approve/Reject Plan  | Side-by-side Diff generation              | Permission Granted/Denied |
| **5\. Act**    | (Automatic)          | File system edit \+ Linter/Test run       | In-place Code Update      |
| **6\. Verify** | (Automatic)          | Git commit or automatic Revert            | Finalized Codebase        |
| **7\. Report** | \--report flag       | Complexity Delta \+ Pattern Summary       | PDF/Markdown Report       |

## **Comparative Methodology: Lessons from Similar Projects**

To ensure the CLI remains at the forefront of the industry, several "Ideas for Forking" or adaptation are identified from existing successful projects.

### **Ideas from Aider**

Aider’s repository map is the gold standard for context management. The proposed CLI should "fork" the logic of using a graph ranking algorithm (PageRank) to select which symbols are most "important" to show the LLM.8 Additionally, the "Git-native" approach—where every AI interaction is a commit—provides an essential safety net for in-place editing.27

### **Ideas from Claude Code**

Claude Code’s "autonomous multi-step task execution" is vital. Instead of just suggesting a single line, the tool should be able to navigate the codebase, find where a pattern is repeated, and execute the refactor across multiple directories in one session.7 The use of "subagents" for specific tasks (like a "Debugger Agent" that only runs tests) allows the main "Orchestrator" to keep its context lean.37

### **Ideas from RIdiom and DeIdiom**

The specialized "syntactic pattern detection" from RIdiom should be integrated into the "Investigation" phase of the CLI. By specifically contrasting the AST of non-idiomatic code against "Pythonic" or "Java-idiomatic" templates, the tool can provide highly accurate refactoring suggestions that human developers find more "standard" and "popular".9

### **Ideas from MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

By making the CLI "MCP-compliant," it can easily integrate with third-party reasoning tools, such as the mettamatt/code-reasoning server or context7 for library documentation.10 This ensures the tool remains extensible and can benefit from the broader ecosystem of AI coding tools.

## **Conclusion and Future Outlook**

The development of a local CLI application for code compression and autonomous refactoring represents a significant advancement in developer experience. By shifting the focus from "writing more" to "knowing more with less," this tool addresses the core challenge of modern software maintenance. The technical feasibility is supported by the convergence of high-performance parsers (Tree-sitter), unified model interfaces (LiteLLM), and agentic reasoning frameworks.  
As the project progresses, the focus must remain on "Safety and Trust." Developers are inherently protective of their codebases; therefore, the Git-integrated, test-validated, and human-approved workflow is not merely a feature, but the product's foundation.39 The inclusion of advanced metrics like LM-CC ensures that the refactored code is optimized for the next generation of software development, where AI and humans collaborate within a highly dense and semantically clear environment. Ultimately, by compressing the "Scope of Code," the application liberates programmers from the burden of boilerplate, allowing them to focus on the high-level architecture and creative problem-solving that define professional software engineering.2
